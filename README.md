## Helping CrossLead identify successful  business objectives

This post describes my project as a Fellow in Insight Data Science, a program that helps academics make the transition to industry.

At Insight, I consulted with CrossLead, an enterprise SaaS platform that provides a leadership and management system to optimize organizational performance. They help companies organize their business strategies, principles, and goals into a hierarchical structure that helps them track progress and link objectives accross different teams and levels of their organization. 

CrossLead’s management model uses an Alignment Triangle, in which the company’s vision stands at the top, and then progressively more concrete ways of attaining it are stacked below it in a hierarchy. They currently provide a platform to construct this pyramid by linking the different teams in the company and nudging their clients towards a framework (within their platform) in which smaller, more concrete initiatives are linked to more comprehensive strategies and then to broader objectives and finally to the company’s mission and vision. They also provide a dashboard and some analytics that lets them track the progress of each goal (in all levels of the hierarchy) and link the team members responsible for it.
